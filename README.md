# GeoMapping with Leaflet

## Overview:
the United States Geological Survey, or USGSproviding scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. earthquake data

html and Javascript  and leaflet visualize an earthquake data set. 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude. the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. 
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
## Data:
The USGS provides earthquake data


tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.

Plot a second data set on our map.


Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.


Add layer controls to our map.
